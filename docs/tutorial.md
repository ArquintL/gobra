# A Tutorial on Gobra
Gobra is an automated, modular verifier for heap-manipulating, concurrent Go programs. Gobra supports a large subset of Go, including Goâ€™s interfaces and primitive data structures.

Gobra verifies memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications. It takes as input a Go program annotated with assertions such as pre- and postconditions and loop invariants.

This tutorial presents Gobra's features and how they can be used ...
