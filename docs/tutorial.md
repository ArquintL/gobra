# A Tutorial on Gobra
## Introduction
*Gobra* is an automated, modular verifier for heap-manipulating, concurrent Go programs. Gobra supports a large subset of Go, including Goâ€™s interfaces and primitive data structures.
Gobra verifies memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications.
It takes as input a `.gobra` file containing a Go program annotated with assertions such as pre- and postconditions and loop invariants.

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to Gobra and showcases some of its main features.

## Overview
As is the case with Go, Gobra program consists of a package clause followed by a list of imports declarations and followed by a list of member declarations. A member can be one of the following:
1. Functions and Methods
2. User-defined type
3. Implementation Proof
4. Global constants
5. Global variables (not supported yet)

The following section describes each kind of member in detail.
### Top-Level Declarations
#### Functions and Methods 
include specifications

#### Type Definitions
- in the interface section, mention interface proofs
### Built-in types

### Imports and Support for the Std Lib

## Examples
### 1. ???
```go
package preliminaries

requires 0 <= n
ensures sum == n * (n+1)/2
func sum(n int) (sum int) {
    sum := 0
    invariant 0 <= i && i <= n + 1
    invariant sum == i * (i-1)/2
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
            sum += i
    }
    return sum
}
```

### 2. ???

### 3. Concurrency

## Language Summary
### Members
### Expressions
(ghost and non-ghost)
### Statements
