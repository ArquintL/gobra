# A Tutorial on Gobra
## Introduction
*Gobra* is an automated, modular verifier for heap-manipulating, concurrent Go programs. Gobra supports a large subset of Go, including Goâ€™s interfaces and primitive data structures.
Gobra verifies memory safety, crash safety, data-race freedom, and user-provided specifications.
It takes as input a `.gobra` file containing a Go program annotated with 
specifications such as function pre- and postconditions and loop invariants.

In order to prove the correctness of a program, Gobra verifies
all functions and methods according to their specifications. If one of the
methods fails to meet its specification, the verification fails and Gobra 
reports the error.

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to Gobra and showcases some of its main features. TODO: OUTLINE

## Structure of Gobra Programs
As is the case with Go, Gobra programs consist of a *package clause* followed
by a list of *imports declarations*, finally followed by a list of 
*top-level declarations*.
The following sections describe in detail each component of a Gobra program.

## Language Overview
### Package Clauses
```go
package pkgName
```
- The `package` keyword defines the package to which the file belongs.
- A package clause begins must appear at the beginning of a source file.
- Every Gobra file belongs necessarily to one and only one package.

### Import Declarations
```go
import (
    "pkg1"
    "pkg2"
    ...
    "pkgN"
)
```
- Import Declarations begin with the `import` keyword and state that the enclosing Gobra file depends on the imported packages
- The imported packages are specified by name if they belong to the standard
library, or by path. In the second case, the path must be relative to the
`GOPATH` environment variable.
- Gobra provides an incomplete but growing support for the Go standard library. Currently, it has partial support for the packages 
`encoding/binary`, `net`, `strconv`, `strings`, `sync`, and `time`.
### Top-level declarations
#### Functions and Methods
```go
/* Functions */
requires ... /* preconditions */
ensures ... /* postconditions */
func funcName(arg1 type1, ..., argN typeN) typeRet {
    ... /* function body */
}

/* Methods */
requires ... /* preconditions */
ensures ... /* postconditions */
func (receiver type0) methodName(arg1 type1, ..., argN typeN) typeRet {
    ... /* method body */
}
```
- Gobra supports Go's syntax for functions and methods. In the following
observations, we will refer only to functions, but they generalize to methods
as well.
- The specification for a function is provided as a list of pre- and 
postcontions.
    - TODO: Explain preconditions. Preconditions are specified using 
    the `requires` keyword, followed by an [assertion](#assertions)
    parameterized by the function arguments.
    - TODO: Explain postconditions. Postconditions are specified using 
    the `ensures` keyword, followed by an assertion parameterized by
    the function arguments and the return value.
    - If no pre- or postconditions are provided, they default to `true`.

In the snippet before, the variables `argX`, with X ranging from 1 to N, are variable names and `typeX` ... corresponds to names of types. The last argument in the list can be variadic.

Explain pre and postconditions

Gobra allows additional kinds of functions and methods besides the ones in Gobra. We now present such variations for functions. All considerations also apply to methods.

(TODO: mention that methods consist of statements and specs consist of assertions and refer to the corresponding sections)
##### Pure Functions

##### Ghost Functions
Gobra supports *ghost code*, i.e., code introduced only for the purposes of
verification. Ghost code cannot influence the result of non-ghost code, which we call *actual code*.
```go
/* Ghost Functions */
ghost /* ghost modifier */
requires ... 
ensures ... 
func funcName(arg1 type1, ..., argN typeN) {
    ...
}
```
Ghost arguments in all kinds of functions.


Besides pre and postconditions, functions and methods can be qualified with
the `ghost` and `pure` modifiers

#### Type Declarations



--------------------------------------

## Not integrated in main text
### Member Declarations
A member can be one of the following:
1. Functions and Methods
2. User-defined types (TODO: mention in this section the already supported types)
2. Predicates
3. Implementation Proofs
4. Global constants
5. Global variables (not supported yet)
This section presents each component of Gobra programs in order.
The following section describes each kind of member in detail.

TODO: after top-level declarations: statements, assertions(maybe explain permissions here), expressions

- Ghost
- Ghost arguments
- Pure (mention thesis to extend syntax of ...)
- Spec
- Abstract


include specifications

### Built-in types
## Type Definitions
- in the interface section, mention interface proofs

### Imports and Support for the Std Lib

### Statements

### Expressions
#### Assertions

## Examples
### 1. ???
```go
package preliminaries

requires 0 <= n
ensures sum == n * (n+1)/2
func sum(n int) (sum int) {
    sum := 0
    invariant 0 <= i && i <= n + 1
    invariant sum == i * (i-1)/2
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
            sum += i
    }
    return sum
}
```

### 2. ???

### 3. Concurrency
